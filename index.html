          <p>2023 was the start of the sixth season of the Overwatch league and potentially the last season of Overwatch league as we know it. With myself being a huge enjoyer of not only esports, but specifically Overwatch, this has been both a sad and exciting time for me. This is all due to the final culmination of my favorite team the Atlanta Reign who came into the season with arguably the best roster ever assembled. However, with this star-studded roster that we had, we somehow completely did not show up during playoffs and were knocked out during the first round. After this disappointing display I personally did not watch the rest of playoffs or the championship match being overwhelmingly sick to my stomach having to face my brother whom I have been bragging to the entire season.</p>

          <p>After not only having the best record ever recorded of 14 wins and 2 losses (1st seed), and winning the midseason tournament with a perfect record of 8 wins 0 losses, most people would have Atlanta winning the entire season. However, with an ever changing meta and characters who were good becoming bad and vice versa, we were not prepared to continue our dominance. We would find ourselves in the playoffs facing the Hangzhou Spark that we beat 3-0 during the midseason tournament, losing 3-0 ourselves and falling to the lower bracket. We would then face the London Spitfire who were seeded 7th in the playoffs losing 3-0 to them too, who is a team known to never play meta. Overall this was the most disappointing season for Atlanta since we have never actually been a great team, but when we had the opportunity to take the entire league especially during the potentially final season, the lights just were too bright and we fell hard.</p>

        <h3>Assassin's Creed: Syndicate</h3>
        <address class="author"><a href="https://github.com/CharlesDrake">Charles Drake</a></address>
        <time datetime="2023-10-29" title="October 29, 2023">October 29, 2023</time>
        <p>I have recently begun to play games that I have either never played before or have played, but want to play again due to nostalgia. One game that I am playing for the first time is Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate. A game that takes place in London during the Second Industrial Revolution. Unlike many of the other main Assassin’s Creed games, this game not only has the player playing as two twin assassins, Jacob and Evie Frye, but also having the first playable female character in an Assassin’s Creed game. With recently finishing this game there are some things about the game that I personally believed were great about the game and some things that I believe could have been better even for the time that the game was released in 2015.</p>
        <p><img alt="Image of the Frye twins: Jacob and Evie" src="Images/JacobandEvieFrye.jpg"></p>
        <p>One thing that I believe that was great about the game was the different playstyles the game allows the player to use. While there are missions specifically for either twin, the player has free choice as to who they want to traverse the world as or side quest as well. Jacob is not your typical assassin and likes to be aggressive, preferring to hand to hand combat opposed to the typical sneaking and hiding that most assassins are used to. Evie, on the other hand, is your typical assassin, preferring to sneak and attack from the shadows. A personal critique that I have is the color and outfits in the game. The different outfits for the twins did not look any different from each other and I found them all to be pretty boring except for an outfit that you have to find collectables to unlock. Also, even though this game takes place during the industrial revolution, I do not believe the game needed to look super bland and almost gray.</p>
